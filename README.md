#Small Joys: Meteor Uploadcare

A little package that adds Uploadcare to Meteor, and gives you some methods for storage and removal.

Note: This package is developed for the Small Joys workflow. If you require something a little lighter, we recommend <a href="https://github.com/nate-strauser/meteor-uploadcare-plus/">Nate Strauser's package</a>.

###Credits
This package is based up Nate Strauser's <a href="https://github.com/nate-strauser/meteor-uploadcare-plus/">uploadcare-plus</a> package. We've updated the widget version and included our own methods.
